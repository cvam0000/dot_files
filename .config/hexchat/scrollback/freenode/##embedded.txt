T 1582926512 18<angelo__18>	maunix, thanks, seems he was able to understand the source of the issue
T 1582926537 18<angelo__18>	looks like shielding the mcu is not a solution, since noise comes in also from ground that can't be shielded
T 1582926660 18<angelo__18>	so he will have to get a better metalization of the flash parable, and connect it to ground
T 1582926745 18<angelo__18>	and maybe something else. Well, yes, he has good knowledge of such issues seems. Let's see. Can post back here the solution then
