Feb 29 03:18:32 <angelo__>	maunix, thanks, seems he was able to understand the source of the issue
Feb 29 03:18:57 <angelo__>	looks like shielding the mcu is not a solution, since noise comes in also from ground that can't be shielded
Feb 29 03:21:00 <angelo__>	so he will have to get a better metalization of the flash parable, and connect it to ground
Feb 29 03:22:25 <angelo__>	and maybe something else. Well, yes, he has good knowledge of such issues seems. Let's see. Can post back here the solution then
